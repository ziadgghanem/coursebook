**<u>Definition(Vector Field):</u>**

Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a set such that for every point $p \in \Omega$ we associate a vector $\Phi(p) \in \mathbb{R}^n.$

We call the map $\Phi: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ a vector field over $\Omega$
</div>

In particular we are concerned with _planar vector fields_ which are defined over sets $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$.

Any planar vector field $\Phi: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ is specified by two _component vectors,_ which are real functions $\phi, \psi: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that
> $$\Phi(p) = <\phi(p), \psi(p)>$$

To describe a vector field as continuous is equivalent to describing ech of its component vectors as continuous functions.

**Example: Complex Functions**

Any complex function $f: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$
can be decomposed into real and imaginary component functions
> $$f(z) = f(x+iy) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) = <u(x,y), v(x,y)>$$
</div>
