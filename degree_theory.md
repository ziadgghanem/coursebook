### algebras and the existence of bounded/periodic solutions to dynamical systems 

Definitionss: Let $$V$$ be a vector space over a field $$K$$ (either $$\mathbb{R}$$ or $$\mathbb{C}$$). We equip $$V$$ with an additional operation $$*: V \times V \rightarrow V$$ satisfying the properties: $$\forall a,b,c \in V \, \forall \alpha, \beta \in K$$
1. (Right Distributivity) $$(\alpha a + \beta b) * c = \alpha(a*c) + \beta(b*c)$$
2. (Left Distributivity) $$c * (\alpha a + \beta b) = \alpha(c*a) + \beta(c*b)$$
Then we say that $$V$$ is an algebra over the field $$K$$ or we may call $$V$$ a $$K$$-algebra and write $$(V, *)$$.
